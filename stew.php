					<h3>Ghormeh sabzi</h3>
	
					<p>Ghormeh sabzi is a Persian herb stew. It is a popular dish in current day Iran, Iraq, and Azerbaijan; traditional and very popular, served when family members return home after being away.

Ghormeh means stewed and sabzi literally means greens, which is herbs in English. The main ingredients are a variety of sauteed herbs, mainly spinach, parsley, spring onions, fresh coriander; seasoned with the key herb, dried fenugreek leaves (called shambalileh in Persian), which gives it the peculiar flavour.

They are cooked with beans (red kidney beans, rose cocoa beans, haricot beans, etc) onions and most importantly pierced dried ‘limu-omani’ (Persian sundried limes). I prepare my version as follows and it serves </p>

					<h3>Zereshk Polo</h3>
					<p>
				When I was a kid word got out that I loved Zereshk Polow. When information as such gets out all of a sudden it seems as though that’s the one dish that people keep on making for you.  As such,  I have had plenty of it in my life time. PLENTY! As an adult I still love it as I love zereshk,  barberries, and also because it is such a simple polow to make.  Of course, let us not forget that I love all things sour and barberries are indeed sour by nature.

					<h3>Khoreshteh Aloo</h3>
					<p>
I love nothing more than a Khoresht that is simple to make which tastes great yet has few ingredients and cooking steps. If you think the same way I do, then you will love this recipe for Khoreshteh Aloo, Prune Stew. I love prunes and for me they are definitely a wintery type of ingredient. This recipes is simple, yet very delicious and very comforting.
